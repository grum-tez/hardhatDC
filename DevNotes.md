It looks like the path of trying to get a local network running for a dev workflow is hopeless

Not sure if this is because the local network is ETH based and this is causing an issue, or something to do with metamask

However, next attempt you should try to just stick to using the etherlink testnet

YOu may have to come up with a solution around that where there is still an automatic process for updating the ABI whenever you make a new update to the contract

Also, will need to version the contract and have to come up with a way to manage that. Maybe it is as simple as changing a comment in the contract.
